Dotfiles: Best Way to Store in a Bare Git Repository
====================================================

_Disclaimer: the title is slightly hyperbolic, there are other proven solutions to the problem. I do think the technique below is very elegant though._

Recently I read about this amazing technique in an [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797) on people's solutions to store their [dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-file). User `StreakyCobra` [showed his elegant setup](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11071754) and ... It made so much sense! I am in the process of switching my own system to the same technique. The only pre-requisite is to install [Git](/git).

In his words the technique below requires:

No extra tooling, no symlinks, files are tracked on a version control system, you can use different branches for different computers, you can replicate you configuration easily on new installation.

The technique consists in storing a [Git bare repository](http://www.saintsjd.com/2011/01/what-is-a-bare-git-repository/) in a "_side_" folder (like `$HOME/.cfg` or `$HOME/.myconfig`) using a specially crafted alias so that commands are run against that repository and not the usual `.git` local folder, which would interfere with any other Git repositories around.

Starting from scratch
---------------------

If you haven't been tracking your configurations in a Git repository before, you can start using this technique easily with these lines:

    git init --bare $HOME/.cfgalias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles noecho "alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'" >> $HOME/.bashrc

*   The first line creates a folder `~/.cfg` which is a [Git bare repository](http://www.saintsjd.com/2011/01/what-is-a-bare-git-repository/) that will track our files.
*   Then we create an alias `config` which we will use instead of the regular `git` when we want to interact with our configuration repository.
*   We set a flag - local to the repository - to hide files we are not explicitly tracking yet. This is so that when you type `config status` and other commands later, files you are not interested in tracking will not show up as `untracked`.
*   Also you can add the alias definition by hand to your `.bashrc` or use the the fourth line provided for convenience.

I packaged the above lines into a [snippet](https://bitbucket.org/snippets/nicolapaolucci/ergX9) up on Bitbucket and linked it from a short-url. So that you can set things up with:

    curl -Lks http://bit.do/cfg-init | /bin/bash

After you've executed the setup any file within the `$HOME` folder can be versioned with normal commands, replacing `git` with your newly created `config` alias, like:

    config statusconfig add .vimrcconfig commit -m "Add vimrc"config add .bashrcconfig commit -m "Add bashrc"config push

Install your dotfiles onto a new system (or migrate to this setup)
------------------------------------------------------------------

If you already store your configuration/dotfiles in a [Git repository](/git), on a new system you can migrate to this setup with the following steps:

*   Prior to the installation make sure you have committed the alias to your `.bashrc` or `.zsh`:

    alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'

*   And that your source repository ignores the folder where you'll clone it, so that you don't create weird recursion problems:

    echo ".cfg" >> .gitignore

*   Now clone your dotfiles into a [bare](http://www.saintsjd.com/2011/01/what-is-a-bare-git-repository/) repository in a "_dot_" folder of your `$HOME`:

    git clone --bare <git-repo-url> $HOME/.cfg

*   Define the alias in the current shell scope:

    alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'

*   Checkout the actual content from the bare repository to your `$HOME`:

    config checkout

*   The step above might fail with a message like:

    error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout:    .bashrc    .gitignorePlease move or remove them before you can switch branches.Aborting

This is because your `$HOME` folder might already have some stock configuration files which would be overwritten by Git. The solution is simple: back up the files if you care about them, remove them if you don't care. I provide you with a possible rough shortcut to move all the offending files automatically to a backup folder:

    mkdir -p .config-backup && \config checkout 2>&1 | egrep "\s+\." | awk {'print $1'} | \xargs -I{} mv {} .config-backup/{}

*   Re-run the check out if you had problems:

    config checkout

*   Set the flag `showUntrackedFiles` to `no` on this specific (local) repository:

    config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no

*   You're done, from now on you can now type `config` commands to add and update your dotfiles:

    config statusconfig add .vimrcconfig commit -m "Add vimrc"config add .bashrcconfig commit -m "Add bashrc"config push

Again as a shortcut not to have to remember all these steps on any new machine you want to setup, you can create a simple script, [store it as Bitbucket snippet](https://bitbucket.org/snippets/nicolapaolucci/7rE9K) like I did, [create a short url](http://bit.do/) for it and call it like this:

    curl -Lks http://bit.do/cfg-install | /bin/bash

For completeness this is what I ended up with (tested on many freshly minted [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) containers to test it out):

    git clone --bare https://bitbucket.org/durdn/cfg.git $HOME/.cfgfunction config {   /usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME [email protected]}mkdir -p .config-backupconfig checkoutif [ $? = 0 ]; then  echo "Checked out config.";  else    echo "Backing up pre-existing dot files.";    config checkout 2>&1 | egrep "\s+\." | awk {'print $1'} | xargs -I{} mv {} .config-backup/{}fi;config checkoutconfig config status.showUntrackedFiles no
